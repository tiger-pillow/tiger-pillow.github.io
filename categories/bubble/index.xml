      <description>How delightful are those fresh, untouched pages with enticing stories hidden in them! The pleasure of reading is drastically elevated during exam periods (alas how I started this blog!). Every dreadful task seems to be more pleasant when compared to reviewing. So here I am, happy to be back with another year&amp;rsquo;s reading records and comments.
I like both fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction is not immediately &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo;, and thus it is looked-down by some of my more career-oriented acquitances.</description>

      <description>From July 21st to August 7th, Thi and I bikepacked around Iceland, in total we rode 1553.29 km.
Here are the maps. I tried to find some existing online tools that would showcase our GPX files entirely, but Google is the one that works somewhat decent and it only shows half&amp;hellip;.maybe this should be my next coding project. The tags are our beginning/ending spot (also where we camped)
  Origin I suggested to Thi in April that I want to cycle around Iceland, and to my surprise he jumped onto the boat!</description>

      <description>Running past Sagrada Familia, Gaudi&amp;rsquo;s work is just mesmerizing.
In August 2021, I signed up for the Barcelona marathon with one question in mind &amp;ndash; I just want to know if I have the willpower to do it again. I&amp;rsquo;ve amped up my milage significantly since then, over 200km for the past three months. I just finished the race in 3 hour 40 minutes (still short of BQ time, but that&amp;rsquo;s the next target!</description>

      <description>I got &amp;ldquo;on the wagon&amp;rdquo; in August &amp;ndash; meaning that I&amp;rsquo;ve amped up my milage significantly, over 120 miles per month, and sometimes even over 100km per week. Two months have passed since then, and I have learned so much about my body, my own mental processes, time, dealing with expectations, past performances etc.
I have a troubled relationship with running &amp;ndash; I used to run excessively to lose weight, was borderline aneoric, had anxiety attack due to running races.</description>

      <description>1. The world for sale by Jack Farchy and Javier Blas Wow I love book like this, introduces me to a whole new field I was unaware of before &amp;ndash; commodity trading. It&amp;rsquo;s not the biggest finance sector, but it plays such a vital role in geopolitics. Surprisingly also, Switzerland is a country with many many powerful commodity trading firms.
2.The Chip War by Chris Miller Incredible book about the semiconductor industry &amp;ndash; why it&amp;rsquo;s one of the greatest engineering feat of human beings, and why it&amp;rsquo;s inevitably a global effort.</description>

      <description>How delightful are those fresh, untouched pages!
The pleasure of reading is multiplied during exam periods. Everything seems fun when compared to reviewing(alas how I started this blog!) So here I am, happy to be back with 2022&amp;rsquo;s reading record.
I like both fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction is not immediately &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo;,and thus it is looked-down by some of my more career-oriented acquitances. But it teaches us so much about life. Biographies and history are bounded by the limits of real events.</description>

      <description>I sometimes find my words lacking the power, the forcefulness that my emotions carry, so out of laziness, I borrow others&#39; words. These are some recent ones.
On dressing up for the male gaze (from Neapolitan Novels)  In recent years I had begun to be interested in fashion, to educate my taste under Adele&amp;rsquo;s guidance, and now I enjoyed dressing up. But sometimes &amp;ndash; especially when I had dressed not only to make a good impression in general but for a man &amp;ndash; preparing myself (this was the word) seemed to me to have something ridiculous about it.</description>

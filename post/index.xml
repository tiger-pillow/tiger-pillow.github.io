      <description>Some content that have helped me tremendously in getting through Yale at tough times.
Some quotes that I held dear to my heart on double major  &amp;ldquo;Hence the vogue for double majors. It isn’t enough anymore to take a bunch of electives in addition to your primary focus, to roam freely across the academic fields, making serendipitous connections and discoveries, the way that American higher education was designed ( uniquely, among the world’s systems) to allow you to do.</description>

      <description>The juicy part! Except mine isn&amp;rsquo;t really juicy.
Friendships To be perfectly honest I had always struggled making friends or maintaining friendships, and especially at Yale. After four years, I have gotten to know some people (I am an acquitance with maybe 5% of my class), and call maybe half a dozen people &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;, and have two people who I talk to frequently enough.
I long for the kind of &amp;ldquo;I will always be there for you&amp;rdquo; friendship, as depicted in movies or books, the kind between Harry Ron and Hermione.</description>

      <description>If you are interested in doing research at the undergraduate level, read on! I had many pitfalls to write this guide for you.
My experience with different labs Disclaimer: I have nothing bad to say about the following professors (except Van Tessel perhaps). My experience /time spent in each lab doesn&amp;rsquo;t even qualify me to judge in most cases. I left because incompatibility and my own problems &amp;ndash; see reflections later on.</description>

      <description>Snowboarded for 50 days this season. Wish I could say this every year. Here are the reviews!   Winter Park/ Mary Jane  Best tree runs! Practically skiable everywhere, good food, and Eagle Wind if you got lucky.    Snowbird Steep, Scary but So Much Fun!    Aspen Highlands
Personally I love hard workouts, and nothing beats the hike up Highland bowl. Awesome trees, that chair was slow though.</description>

      <description>I have two finals left, yet I decide to write about my Yale experience. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s more legitimate than procrastinating by reflecting?
I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at Yale. My grades are mediocre, and I have never been inducted in any honorary society or organizations. I am by no means among &amp;ldquo;the bright&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the hardworking&amp;rdquo; ones at Yale, and very much just an ordinary international student struggling on a day-to-day basis.</description>

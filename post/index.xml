      <description>Snowboarded for 50 days this season. Wish I could say this every year. Here are the reviews!   Winter Park/ Mary Jane  Best tree runs! Practically skiable everywhere, good food, and Eagle Wind if you got lucky.    Snowbird Steep, Scary but So Much Fun!    Aspen Highlands
Personally I love hard workouts, and nothing beats the hike up Highland bowl. Awesome trees, that chair was slow though.</description>

      <description>Hi,
I am a senior at Yale majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I can still say this because I will graduate in two weeks, and it will feel a bit strange to not introduce myself as a student.
I am broadly interested in evolutionary biology and outdoors life (snowboarding/skiing, hiking, trail running, figure skating, badminton). I plan to attend Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne starting September 2021.

      <description>If you are interested in doing research at the undergraduate level, read on! I had many pitfalls to write this guide for you.
My experience with different labs Disclaimer: I have nothing bad to say about the following professors (except Van Tessel perhaps). My experience /time spent in each lab doesn&amp;rsquo;t even qualify me to judge in most cases. I left because incompatibility and my own personality &amp;ndash; see reflections later on.</description>

      <title>Yale Reflections #1 - Courses</title>

      <description>I have two finals left, yet I decide to write about my Yale experience. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s better than procrastinating by reflecting?
I majored in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at Yale, graduating with 38.5 credits (requirement is 36). My GPA is around 3.82, which is around the top 30% cutoff among undergrads. I am by no means among &amp;ldquo;the bright&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the hardworking&amp;rdquo; ones at Yale, and very much just a mediocre international student struggling on a day-to-day basis.</description>
